BiNCheWeb
=========

A dynamic web project that performs enrichment analysis based on ChEBI ontology using [BiNChE](https://github.com/pcm32/BiNChe). A running version of BiNChE Web is available at the [EBI's](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) webpage [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/tools/binche/). For more details regarding usage of BiNChE, please see our [wiki](https://github.com/pcm32/BiNCheWeb/wiki/BiNChE), which explains how to use the web interface, graph pruning strategies, how to graphically explore results, use cases and how to use the core library through Java.
